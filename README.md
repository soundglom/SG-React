#Soundglom React
This project is a refactor of a previous version from Angular to React/Redux. With consideration to the multiple user stories and their implementations, we've found that with React, application scaling to meet the demands of the user story is much easier. React is also giving us more control over how we want to implement, connect and keep components autonomous. If you'd like to contribute, send a message and we'll provide you with the User Story.

See the original [Soundglomerate repo](https://github.com/De-La-Soul/soundglomerate) for more information.
