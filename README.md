#Soundglom React
This project is a refactor of a previous version from Angular to React/Redux. With consideration to the multiple user stories and their implementations, we've found that React is scaling better when adding new features. It's also giving us more control over how I want to implement components. If you'd like to contribute, send a message and we'll provide you with the User Story.

See the original [Soundglomerate repo](https://github.com/De-La-Soul/soundglomerate) for more information.
